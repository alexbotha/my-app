# Football Index

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome, to Football Index. Fancy keeping a score of your favourite football players in a tidy index? Look no further. Football Index allows users to add their heroes from the game and store in a neat array. All you have to do is fill in some information and add a photo link, boom. You're well on your way to building out your GOAT index.
